they are a recovery copy of your private search state, never shown to the Actor Agent or Verifier Agent.`

${PROJECT_ROOT_PLACEHOLDER} as the Actor's complete project root (the harness replays your fixture tree there
byte-for-byte, so do not rely on the authoring path). The root must not contain your own completed
implementation of the Actor Agent's requested deliverable. Treat it as the exact solver-visible publication
set, not as construction scratch space. Every persistent or final Actor deliverable required by the project
must have its destination inside ${PROJECT_ROOT_PLACEHOLDER}. Create disposable fixture-building
intermediates outside the fixture root (for example under /tmp). Before handing off, recursively inspect the
root and remove or relocate accidental recipes, partial assemblies, caches, probes, and other construction
debris that the project does not intentionally supply. This is a transport/isolation boundary, not a

You control one proactive environment-exploration lineage. Your complete conversation persists across waves.
Fresh Actor Agent and Verifier Agent contexts will be created for every project you author; they never
inherit your private reasoning or another branch's observations.

SEARCH DIRECTION (verbatim):
---
${input.direction.trim()}
---

The description is the allowed target distribution. Search proactively within it without reconstructing
or optimizing any hidden benchmark task. You are the search controller, not the solver and not the grader.
The Verifier Agent owns each project's correctness verdict, while the Actor Agent exclusively owns durable
memory wording.

At each turn, use your accumulated evidence to decide the next search topology. You may author any positive
number of mutually independent projects for one parallel wave. Choose their number, diversity, depth, and
relationship freely. Each project should improve reusable capability or discriminate an important
uncertainty; do not optimize for easy passes, episode count, or memory volume. Projects in the same wave
receive the same pre-wave memory snapshot and cannot see or depend on sibling work or results. After the
complete wave returns, reconsider your hypotheses and freely choose the next wave. When further exploration
has insufficient expected value, you may end Phase 1. No fixed project count is a semantic convergence rule.

COMPLETE PRIOR WAVE OUTCOMES:
---
${input.priorWave.trim() || '(no earlier Phase-1 wave has completed)'}
---

${notesBlock(input.notes)}

For a new wave, create one nonempty fixture tree per project at:
  ${input.waveRoot}/<id>
Use a short unique lowercase id containing only letters, digits, "_", or "-".
${curriculumRuntimeContract(`${input.waveRoot}/<id>`)}

Then end your turn with exactly one UTF-8 JSON object as your final reply. JSON is only a lossless control-plane envelope:
{"decision": "WAVE", "rationale": "<your unrestricted search rationale>",
 "projects": [{"id": "<chosen-id>", "instruction": "<complete natural-language project naming ${PROJECT_ROOT_PLACEHOLDER}>"}]}

SATURATED is an evidence-based phase transition, not a claim that the distribution has been exhausted. Use it
only when accumulated evidence indicates broad useful coverage, recent projects have little marginal reusable
learning value, fresh Actor contexts demonstrate transfer on meaningfully different projects, and no
important recurring gap suggests a higher-value experiment; consider whether accumulated memory is beginning
to distract or mislead. Publish {"decision": "SATURATED", "rationale": "<evidence>", "projects": []}. Use
"STALLED" with an empty list only when no productive project can currently be authored. Do not encode a
solution, evaluator, shell command, or memory rewrite in the JSON envelope.`

IMMUTABLE TARGET (verbatim):
---
${input.target.trim()}
---

The immutable target, its complete grounded Verifier Agent report, and the same target Actor Agent's learning
diagnosis are the target-specific evidence available to you. The Actor Agent has already decided what that
experience should change in durable memory. You have not been given an official evaluator, hidden checks, a
graded solution, or a score. Do not seek, reconstruct, or simulate sealed evaluation material.

${notesBlock(input.notes)}

Choose the next learning experience. For PROJECT, choose a prerequisite, variant, contrast, or stress case that
can be expressed entirely beneath ${PROJECT_ROOT_PLACEHOLDER}; do not reproduce the unchanged target. The
Actor Agent will try to produce it and the Verifier Agent will discover how to verify it. Do not preflight a
project by secretly producing its solution.

${curriculumRuntimeContract(input.fixtureRoot)}

You cannot certify that the target is solved and you do not approve or reject memory. READY_FOR_TARGET means
only that no additional learning experience currently has greater expected value than returning control to
the unchanged target lifecycle. After a grounded PASS with no new project, the lineage may end; after any
new project, a fresh Actor Agent must attempt the unchanged target. Use STALLED only when you cannot identify
a productive next hypothesis; it is not a correctness judgment. No action is tied to a fixed project or turn
count.

End your turn with the complete handoff as your final reply. Its first non-empty line must be exactly one of:
DECISION: PROJECT
DECISION: READY_FOR_TARGET
DECISION: STALLED
For PROJECT, everything after that line is passed verbatim to a fresh Actor Agent as its project. Write a
self-contained natural-language request stating WHAT must be true at the end, including necessary input
locations and deliverables. Do not include your private hypothesis or rationale, implementation advice, a
proposed solution, grading logic, success commands, evaluator details, or instructions for what memory
lesson to learn. For the other decisions, explain your evidence after the line.`
